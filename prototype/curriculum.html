        <h2>Curriculum</h2>
          <div>
      <h3>Infants</h3>

      <h4>Ages: 6wks to 16 months</h4>
      <p>“Primary Care” is the key phrase in understanding the quality of care your baby will receive as a part of our Infant Care Program.  Each teacher is assigned a group (no more than 4) of infants to care for. They work hand in hand with each parent to create a specialized care plan for the children in their group.  We offer a safe, warm, and loving environment affording each Infant the best opportunities for growth. We foster this growth through exploration of the world around them. They have access to our centers as well as our Bye-Bye buggies and will take rides on days when weather permits.  Each child is provided with their own crib and sheets.  These are never shared by multiple students and are disinfected as well as laundered several times per day.  We use neutral cleaning products and steam to disinfect this room limiting any harsh chemicals our infants may come into contact with.  To keep our Infant room clean and germ free we restrict access by anyone other than our Infants and Teachers.  We do this in hopes of keeping the germs of the outside world from entering the class.  All of our caring Infant Room Staff treat each child as though he/she is their own.  They are also trained in Infant CPR, First Aid, and we have other staff members with Medication Administration (MAT) training.
      Our teachers set goals with our parents and work with each Infant to reach certain developmental milestones.  We use educational activities that focus on; rolling over, walking, grasping, crawling, pulling up, and mastering of fine motor skills.  Each day the Infants will take part in several group circle times intended to aid in verbal communication and social interaction.  Our staff will engage them in singing songs, reading stories and playing with sensory objects.  Our educators also teach American Sign Language as an alternative form of communication.

      <h3>Toddlers</h3>

      <h4>Ages: 16 months to 24 months</h4>
      <p>Our Toddler room is full of action and adventure!  This room is designed to aid in the growth and development of a toddler by the completion and the refining of skills learned in our Infant room.  Children are given the opportunity to increase core strength, fine and large motor skills, walking, running, jumping, and communication.  Addressing these skills is very important for the future success of the children.
      Our schedule in this class allows the student time to play, learn, rest, and explore the world around them. Circle times include the introduction of colors, shapes, date, time, music, and movement.  Throughout the day the class will sit down together for a few minutes of group learning.  Students will interact socially together and with the teachers to make learning fun.  By using flashcards, sign language, and sensory boxes our teachers aid the children in learning with all of their senses.  The students in this class will engage in table activities each day that focus on strengthening their fine motor skills as well as their ability to follow simple directions.  Our children also have the opportunity to express themselves through guided and free art activities several times weekly.

      <h3>Two Year Olds</h3>

      <h4>24 months to 36 months</h4>
      <p>Our Two Year Old Room is set up for what in some cases can be the most difficult time in a child’s life; the year in which a child may be expected to start caring for his/her self: using the bathroom, wiping, washing their hands, dressing themselves, and proper eating etiquette.  We strive to give each two year old child a sense of routine and structure that will aid in mastering each of these valuable skills.
      Our bathroom is set up specially in order to accommodate potty training with two separate bathrooms and potties side by side at different heights.  This allows 2 children to use the bathroom together helping to eliminate any anxiety or fear that might occur.  We have smaller potties which allow small children to feel comfortable and at peace with the potty itself.  Group potty time helps with the younger children who learn by watching a child that has already mastered the proper technique.  We also have a potty that is standard size which allows the children, who have mastered the smaller potties, to practice the routine of placing and using a step stool and the proper placement and removal of a potty seat.
      At this age our children’s brains are like sponges.  Our teachers’ goal each day is to educate and expose our students to the world around them. Our class has two circle times per day which are designed for group interaction and the establishment of a time to focus on instruction.   After circle time the class breaks up into smaller groups for free play and guided activities.  Each student will have one on one activity time with a teacher developing fine motor skills and creativity through art and expression. Our students also participate with stories, puppet play, and song and dance times daily.

      <h3>Preschool</h3>

      <h4>3 years old</h4>
      <p>This is the first class in our center that begins our students’ preparation for school.  We have a core curriculum based on the Virginia Standards of Learning. We work closely with the Augusta Count School system, and teach from the “Blueprint Curriculum.” Our Preschool Class goes through a year-long process of exploration and exposure to our world, while honing the basic skills needed for advancement into our Jr. Kindergarten class.
      \Our teachers follow a weekly thematic calendar designed to expose the children to what is happening in our world at that time.  The teachers focus class discussions, stories, worksheets, and circle times within each of these weekly themes. Circle times last between 20 and 30 minutes each day and gradually grow in dynamic as the students learn new material. Telling time, date, colors, shapes, counting, Spanish, Math, patterns, letter and number recognition, name recognition, and writing all occur throughout the course of their day, whether it be during circle time or small group activities.

      <h3>Jr. Kindergarten</h3>



      <h4>4 and 5 year olds</h4>
      <p>This class is our next and final step in your children’s preparation for school.  We have a core curriculum based on the Virginia Standards of Learning, and lesson plans based on Augusta County Schools “Blueprint Curriculum.” They will take part in a more traditional school structured day with several circle times and educational activities which create a great classroom setting.  We focus our efforts on teaching our students everything they need to know before entering kindergarten.  This program was established under the supervision of our areas local kindergarten teachers.  They supported us in our efforts to create a class that was structured to resemble the kindergarten classes in our local school system.  They provided us a list of skills that would make our student’s transition to local school systems as effortless as possible, giving our students the skills needed to be successful and advance in their efforts throughout school.
      We offer a structured educational and nurturing environment.  Our teachers conduct two circle times per day centered on our core curriculum and our weekly thematic units.  Our students have a chance to create through free art and express themselves with manipulative and free dance daily.  Guided activities are conducted each day under the supervision of our certified teachers.  We focus on letter recognition, hand writing, one to one correspondence, patterns, telling time, math, and counting.  Our students learn to follow multi-step directions given during class activities.They also work on writing short sentences, sight words, spelling, grammar, Spanish, adding, subtracting, reading, and cognitive skills.   We strive to give our children the best foot forward and prepare them for the education that they will receive when they go to school. Our teachers also promote literacy and language skills through creative storytelling. They participate in cognitive activities, vocabulary expansion, and alphabet knowledge in an effort to expand our student’s oral language skills before heading off to school.
