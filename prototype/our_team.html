  <h3>Kathy Clemson</h3>
<h4>Toddler Activity Director</h4>

<p>Hello! I'm Teacher Kathy, and I'm the Co-Teacher for the teaching center. I started as a floater/substitute in February of 2012, and am very excited to now be able to dedicate myself to the Jr. Toddler class full time! I have a Bachelors degree in Music Education from University of Akron and continuing education in Early Childhood. I've worked with kids of all ages since I was one myself. I love working with children because they're so honest, fun-loving and do and say the most outrageous things! I find myself laughing a lot when I'm with them. I love to see them learn and grow as they discover and experience the world around them.
